# letta-teams: Multi-Agent Orchestration
`letta-teams` is a CLI for orchestrating teams of stateful Letta agents. It enables you to spawn multiple specialized agents, create conversation forks on them, message them individually or in parallel, and monitor their progress through a dashboard.

## Required First Step
Before running messaging/orchestration commands, start the daemon:

```bash
letta-teams daemon --start
letta-teams daemon --status
```

If it is already running, `--status` will confirm.

## Quick Reference
```bash
# Authentication
letta-teams auth [api-key]              # Configure API key (prompts if not provided)
letta-teams auth --show                 # Check auth status
letta-teams auth --clear                # Clear stored token

# Daemon management
letta-teams daemon --start              # Start background daemon
letta-teams daemon --status             # Check daemon status
letta-teams daemon --stop               # Stop daemon

# Spawn teammates
letta-teams spawn <name> <role>         # Create a new teammate
letta-teams spawn <name> <role> --model <model>  # Use specific model
letta-teams spawn <name> <role> --spawn-prompt <text>  # Specialize background init
letta-teams spawn <name> <role> --skip-init  # Skip memory init
letta-teams spawn <name> <role> --no-memfs   # Disable memfs
letta-teams spawn <name> <role> --memfs-startup <mode> # blocking|background|skip
letta-teams spawn <name> <role> --force # Overwrite existing
letta-teams reinit <name>                # Re-run background init
letta-teams reinit <name> --wait         # Wait for init to finish

# Agent council
letta-teams agent-council --prompt "..."            # Start council session
letta-teams agent-council --prompt "..." --participants "A,B"
letta-teams agent-council --prompt "..." --max-turns 7
letta-teams council read [sessionId]                 # Read final decision
letta-teams council --watch [sessionId]              # Wait for final decision

# Conversation forks / targets
letta-teams fork <name> <forkName>       # Create a new conversation fork

# Message teammates or targets
letta-teams message <target> <prompt>     # Send message (fire and forget)
letta-teams message <target> <prompt> -w  # Wait for completion
letta-teams message <target> <prompt> -wv # Wait + show tool calls
letta-teams broadcast <prompt>          # Send to all teammates
letta-teams broadcast <prompt> -w       # Broadcast and wait on all root teammates
letta-teams broadcast --to "A,B/review" <msg>  # Send to specific teammates or forks
letta-teams dispatch A="task1" B/review="task2" # Different messages to different targets
letta-teams dispatch A="task1" B/review="task2" -w  # Dispatch and wait

# Task management
letta-teams tasks                       # List all active tasks
letta-teams task <id>                   # View task details
letta-teams task <id> --wait            # Wait for task to complete
letta-teams task <id> --cancel          # Cancel a running task
letta-teams task <id> --verbose         # Show tool calls

# Monitor progress
letta-teams list                        # List all teammates
letta-teams status                      # Quick status summary
letta-teams dashboard                   # Show current activity
letta-teams dashboard --limit 20        # Show more items
letta-teams dashboard --verbose         # Show full task results
letta-teams info <target>               # Detailed teammate/target info

# Model management
letta-teams model <name>                # Get teammate's model
letta-teams model <name> <model>        # Set teammate's model

# Progress tracking (used by agents to self-report)
letta-teams todo <name> <text>          # Update todo field
letta-teams work <name> <task>          # Set current work
letta-teams work <name> <task> --progress 50  # With progress %
letta-teams problem <name> <problem>    # Report a blocker
letta-teams clear-problem <name>        # Clear blocker
letta-teams update-progress <name> --task "..." --progress 50

# Cleanup
letta-teams prune                       # Clean up stale state
letta-teams prune --dry-run             # Preview what would be pruned
letta-teams remove <name>               # Remove from local config
letta-teams remove <name> --delete-agent # Also delete from Letta server

# Global options
--json                                  # Output as JSON
```

## Core Concepts

### Teammates
A **teammate** is a stateful Letta agent with:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- A name (unique identifier)
- A role (defines their specialty/behavior)
- Access to file operations, shell commands, web search, and memory tools

### Conversation Targets
Each teammate has a **root target** named after the teammate, like `backend`.

Additional targets can exist on the same teammate:
- **memory/init target** used for background initialization
- **fork targets** like `backend/review` or `backend/bugfix`

Use fork targets when you want separate conversation threads without spawning a whole new teammate.

Routing behavior:
- `letta-teams message backend ...` routes to the root target conversation.
- `letta-teams message backend/review ...` routes to that fork conversation.
- Background initialization and `reinit` use a dedicated memory/init target conversation.

### Stateful Memory
Teammates remember conversations. Each teammate has:
- **Core memory** - Always in context (persona, human, project blocks)
- **Archival memory** - Searchable long-term storage
- **Conversation history** - Past messages in the current session

### Background Daemon
Letta Teams uses a background daemon process for handling agent communications:
- Start it first: `letta-teams daemon --start`
- Starts automatically when needed
- Enables fire-and-forget messaging
- Handles parallel execution of tasks
- Tracks task state and progress

### Task System
When you send a message, it creates a **task**:
- Each task has a unique ID
- Tasks can be pending, running, done, or error
- Track tasks with `letta-teams tasks`
- View details with `letta-teams task <id>`

### The Lead Agent
The `lead` teammate is a convention for a coordinator agent:
```bash
letta-teams spawn lead "Coordinator who delegates work to other teammates"
```
Use the lead to delegate work to other teammates and synthesize results.

## Spawning Teammates

### Basic Spawn
```bash
letta-teams spawn developer "Software engineer who writes clean, tested code"
letta-teams spawn researcher "Research specialist who finds and summarizes information"
letta-teams spawn reviewer "Code reviewer who catches bugs and suggests improvements"
```

### Spawn Options
```bash
# Use a specific model
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Control context window size (tokens)
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --context-window 32000
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --context-window 4096

# Add specialization for background memory initialization
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --spawn-prompt "Focus on system design reviews and API boundaries"

# Skip initialization
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --skip-init

# Disable memfs
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --no-memfs

# Control memfs startup behavior
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --memfs-startup blocking
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --memfs-startup background
letta-teams spawn architect "System architect" --memfs-startup skip

# Re-run initialization later
letta-teams reinit architect --prompt "Refresh memory around current backend architecture"

# Overwrite existing teammate
letta-teams spawn dev "Developer" --force
```

### Init + Memfs Behavior
- Spawn defaults to background memory initialization unless `--skip-init` is set.
- `--spawn-prompt` specializes the initialization pass.
- Init/reinit run in a dedicated memory/init conversation target.
- Memfs is enabled by default; disable with `--no-memfs`.
- Memfs startup modes:
  - `blocking`: wait for memfs to be ready before continuing.
  - `background`: initialize memfs asynchronously.
  - `skip`: do not run memfs startup.

## Agent Council

Use council when you want multiple teammates to deliberate and produce one final decision.

Council execution model:
- Participants submit opinions only.
- Review and final reporting are done by a **disposable reviewer agent** spawned internally by `letta-teams`.
- Reviewer model: `letta/auto`.
- Reviewer uses dedicated review instructions/memory blocks for consistent decision quality.
- Reviewer is deleted after use (not persisted as a teammate).

```bash
# Start council
letta-teams agent-council --prompt "Choose the safest rollout plan for auth migration"

# Restrict participants
letta-teams agent-council --prompt "Pick database index strategy" --participants "backend,reviewer"

# Limit turns and add custom behavior prompt
letta-teams agent-council --prompt "Resolve API versioning direction" --message "Prefer backward compatibility" --max-turns 6

# Read/watch final plan
letta-teams council read
letta-teams council --watch
```

Recommended flow:
1. Start daemon (`letta-teams daemon --start`)
2. Start council (`agent-council --prompt ...`)
3. Read final output (`council read`) or follow live (`council --watch`)

### Role Guidelines
Good roles are specific and actionable:
- ✅ `"Python backend developer specializing in FastAPI"`
- ✅ `"QA engineer who writes Playwright tests"`
- ❌ `"Helpful assistant"` (too vague)
- ❌ `"Developer"` (too generic)

## Messaging Teammates

### Individual Messages
```bash
# Fire and forget (returns immediately with task ID)
letta-teams message developer "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Wait for completion
letta-teams message developer "Implement auth" --wait

# Wait and show tool calls
letta-teams message developer "Read package.json" --wait --verbose

# Send to a fork target
letta-teams message developer/review "Review the auth implementation for edge cases"
```

Output with `--wait --verbose` shows tool calls:
```
  Read "package.json"
    ✓ Read 35 lines
[developer] Here's the package.json content...
```

### Conversation Forks
Create a separate conversation thread on the same teammate:

```bash
letta-teams fork developer review
letta-teams message developer/review "Review auth changes with a security lens"
letta-teams info developer/review
```

Use forks when you want the same teammate to handle parallel threads with isolated conversation history.

### Broadcasting
Send the same message to all or specific teammates in parallel:

```bash
# Fire and forget to ALL teammates
letta-teams broadcast "Review the changes in src/auth.ts"

# Wait for all to complete
letta-teams broadcast "Review the changes" --wait

# Send to specific teammates or fork targets
letta-teams broadcast --to "Alice,Bob/review" "Review this PR"

# Exclude specific teammates
letta-teams broadcast "Analyze this PR" --exclude lead,reviewer
```

### Dispatch (Different Messages)
Send different tasks to different teammates in parallel:

```bash
# Format: target=message or target:"message with spaces"
letta-teams dispatch Alice="review the backend code" Bob/review="review the frontend code"

# Wait for all to complete
letta-teams dispatch Alice="review backend" Bob/review="review frontend" --wait

# Assign different files to different teammates
letta-teams dispatch Alice="read src/auth.ts" Bob="read src/api.ts" Charlie="read src/db.ts"
```

### Message Content Tips
Be specific about what you want:
- ✅ `"Create a new file src/utils/date.ts with date formatting functions"`
- ❌ `"Do something with dates"`

Provide context when needed:
```bash
letta-teams message developer "The project uses TypeScript with strict mode. Create a new utility file for date formatting"
```

## Task Management

### Viewing Tasks
```bash
# List all active (pending/running) tasks
letta-teams tasks

# View specific task details
letta-teams task abc123

# Wait for a task to complete
letta-teams task abc123 --wait

# Show full result (no truncation)
letta-teams task abc123 --full

# Show tool calls made during execution
letta-teams task abc123 --verbose

# Cancel a running task
letta-teams task abc123 --cancel
```

### Task Output
```
Task: abc123
  Teammate: developer
  Status: done
  Created: 3/10/2026, 4:30:00 PM
  Started: 3/10/2026, 4:30:01 PM
  Completed: 3/10/2026, 4:30:45 PM

Message:
  Implement user authentication

Result:
  I've implemented JWT-based authentication...
```

## Progress Tracking

### Self-Reporting Progress
Teammates can report their own progress using the CLI:

```bash
# Update current task
letta-teams update-progress developer --task "Building authentication module"

# Update progress percentage
letta-teams update-progress developer --progress 50 --note "3 of 6 files done"

# Report a blocker
letta-teams update-progress developer --problem "Waiting for API documentation"

# Clear a problem
letta-teams update-progress developer --done

# Manage task queue
letta-teams update-progress developer --add-pending "Write tests"
letta-teams update-progress developer --complete-task "Write tests"
```

### Legacy Progress Commands
```bash
# Update todo field
letta-teams todo developer "Working on auth"

# Update work with progress
letta-teams work developer "Building auth" --progress 50 --note "3 of 6 files"

# Report/clear problems
letta-teams problem developer "Blocked on API docs"
letta-teams clear-problem developer
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Quick status of all teammates
letta-teams status

# Dashboard showing current activity
letta-teams dashboard

# Dashboard with more items and full results
letta-teams dashboard --limit 20 --verbose

# Detailed info on specific teammate or target
letta-teams info developer
letta-teams info developer/review
```

## Model Management

```bash
# Get current model
letta-teams model developer
# Output: developer: claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Set model (updates both local config and Letta server)
letta-teams model developer claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

## Cleanup

### Prune Command
Clean up stale state:

```bash
# Prune everything (default)
letta-teams prune

# Preview what would be pruned
letta-teams prune --dry-run

# Prune specific items
letta-teams prune --tasks              # Clear completed task history
letta-teams prune --agents             # Remove idle teammates
letta-teams prune --broken             # Remove teammates with no conversation ID

# Control age threshold
letta-teams prune --older-than 14      # Only items older than 14 days

# Skip confirmation
letta-teams prune -y
```

### Remove Teammates
```bash
# Only removes local config (agent still exists on server)
letta-teams remove dev

# Also deletes from Letta server (irreversible!)
letta-teams remove dev --delete-agent

# Skip confirmation
letta-teams remove dev --delete-agent -y
```

## Teammate Capabilities

Each spawned teammate has access to:

### File Operations
- `Read` - Read file contents
- `Write` - Create new files
- `Edit` - Modify existing files with string replacement
- `Glob` - Find files by pattern
- `Grep` - Search file contents

### Shell & Execution
- `Bash` - Execute shell commands
- `Task` - Spawn subagents for specialized tasks
- `TaskOutput` / `TaskStop` - Manage background tasks

### Web & Research
- `web_search` - Search the web (via Exa)
- `fetch_webpage` - Fetch and parse web content

### Memory Tools
- `core_memory_append` / `core_memory_replace` - Update core memory
- `archival_memory_insert` / `archival_memory_search` - Long-term storage
- `conversation_search` - Search conversation history

### Disabled Tools
Teammates CANNOT use:
- `AskUserQuestion` - No interactive prompts
- `EnterPlanMode` / `ExitPlanMode` - No planning mode

This ensures teammates execute tasks autonomously without blocking for user input.

## Gotchas & Common Issues

### API Key Priority
Environment variable takes priority over stored token:
1. `LETTA_API_KEY` env var (highest priority)
2. Stored token from `letta-teams auth`

```bash
# This will use env var even if you ran 'letta-teams auth'
LETTA_API_KEY=lta_xxx letta-teams spawn dev "Developer"
```

### Teammate Names
Names have restrictions:
- Max 64 characters
- Cannot contain: `< > : " / \ | ? *` or control characters
- Cannot be empty

Invalid names will throw an error before any API calls are made.

### Conversation ID Required
If a teammate has no `conversationId`, messaging will fail:
```
Error: Teammate 'name' has no conversation ID. Re-spawn the teammate.
```
This happens if spawning was interrupted. Re-spawn with `--force` to fix.

### Daemon Issues
If the daemon isn't responding:
```bash
# Check status
letta-teams daemon --status

# Stop and restart
letta-teams daemon --stop
letta-teams daemon --start
```

### Rate Limiting
If you see 429 errors:
1. Reduce number of concurrent broadcasts
2. Wait and retry (retry logic is built-in)
3. Space out API calls

### Corrupted State Files
If `.lteams/<name>.json` becomes corrupted:
- The teammate will be skipped in `list` and `status`
- A warning will be logged to console
- Delete the corrupted file and re-spawn if needed

### Terminal Dashboard
The dashboard requires a TTY terminal for best experience:
- Detects terminal width automatically
- Falls back gracefully on non-TTY (no ANSI colors)
- Use `--json` for non-interactive output:
  ```bash
  letta-teams dashboard --json
  ```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Roles
```bash
# Good - specific and actionable
letta-teams spawn backend "Python FastAPI developer who writes type-hinted code with comprehensive error handling"
letta-teams spawn frontend "React developer specializing in TypeScript and Tailwind CSS"

# Less effective - too vague
letta-teams spawn helper "Helpful coding assistant"
```

### 2. Use Fire-and-Forget for Parallel Work
```bash
# Dispatch multiple tasks without waiting
letta-teams dispatch api="build endpoints" ui="build components" tests="write tests"

# Check status later
letta-teams tasks
letta-teams dashboard
```

### 3. Use --wait for Sequential Dependencies
```bash
# Wait for first task to complete
letta-teams message dev "Create the database schema" --wait

# Then continue with next task
letta-teams message dev "Build the API on top of the schema" --wait
```

### 4. Use Progress Tracking
```bash
# See what everyone is working on
letta-teams status

# Then make informed decisions
letta-teams message dev "Since you're done with auth, start on the user profile feature"
```

### 5. Clean Up Unused Teammates
```bash
# List all teammates
letta-teams list

# Remove ones you don't need
letta-teams remove old-bot --delete-agent

# Or prune idle/broken teammates
letta-teams prune --dry-run
```

## Workflow Examples

### Code Review Team
```bash
# Spawn specialized reviewers
letta-teams spawn security "Security reviewer who checks for vulnerabilities"
letta-teams spawn style "Code style reviewer who enforces linting rules"
letta-teams spawn logic "Logic reviewer who checks for bugs and edge cases"

# Broadcast the review request and wait
letta-teams broadcast "Review src/auth/login.ts" --wait

# Check their findings
letta-teams status
```

### Parallel Feature Development
```bash
# Spawn developers for different parts
letta-teams spawn api "Backend API developer"
letta-teams spawn ui "Frontend UI developer"
letta-teams spawn tests "Test engineer"

# Dispatch parallel work (fire and forget)
letta-teams dispatch api="Create REST endpoints for user CRUD" ui="Create user management page" tests="Write integration tests"

# Monitor progress
letta-teams tasks
letta-teams dashboard
```

### Research Team
```bash
# Spawn researchers for different topics
letta-teams spawn research1 "Research specialist for authentication methods"
letta-teams spawn research2 "Research specialist for database optimization"
letta-teams spawn research3 "Research specialist for caching strategies"

# Broadcast research request and wait for results
letta-teams broadcast "Research best practices for your assigned topic. Summarize findings with code examples." --wait
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No API key found"
```bash
# Set via environment
export LETTA_API_KEY=lta_xxx

# Or configure interactively
letta-teams auth
```

### "Teammate 'x' not found"
```bash
# Check what teammates exist
letta-teams list

# Spawn if needed
letta-teams spawn x "Role description"
```

### "Failed to initialize teammate session"
This means the Letta API didn't return a conversation ID. The agent was created but session failed. Check:
1. API key is valid
2. Letta API is accessible
3. Try re-spawning with `--force`

### "Daemon failed to start"
```bash
# Check log file
cat ~/.lteams/daemon.log

# Try restarting
letta-teams daemon --stop
letta-teams daemon --start
```

### Rate Limiting
If you see 429 errors:
1. Reduce concurrent operations
2. Wait and retry (retry logic is built-in)
3. Space out API calls

### Dashboard Not Updating
- Check terminal supports ANSI codes
- Use `--json` for non-TTY environments
- Verify `.lteams/` directory exists and has valid JSON files
